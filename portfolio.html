<td>My coding journey started when I was in 8th grade and decided to do coding as one of my electives, little did I know that I would enjoy coding to the point it changed my ideal for my livelihood. Although I wasn't sure which coding language, I was best suited for this led me to try a Webpage development class during my freshman year. While I had fun working with HTML especially the table element which made my websites more organized, I wanted to explore the other languages in code. During my sophmore year, I discovered my passion for Cybersecurity and soon motivated to learn Python. Now as a rising junior, I'll be taking Cyber: Systems Tech and Cyber: Net Admin 1 to continue my learing journey and hopes of becoming a cybersecurity engineer!</td>
