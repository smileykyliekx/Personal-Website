A fun Personal Website made through the coding platform: Replit. I made this because I did the Girls Who Code Self Pace Program, I had so much fun making this website. Although I struggled with how to format my website and deciding my color theme.. I learned how to use the table property correctly which definetly benefited the format of my site!! My Home page includes a description of favorite hobbies, foods and and a lovely personal photo. While the Portfolio page showcases my coding journey starting from my 8th grade coding class to my Webpage Development class in high school!
