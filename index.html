<td> <center>I'm a big foodie especially when it comes to desserts! As a kid, I had the sweeth tooth for Peeps and frosted sugar cookies even looking at images online about these sweets made me hungry for it. Although by living upbroad, I became more open to different kinds of foods! When I was living in Germany, I fell in love with bratwursts and schnitzels which were one of the best german cusines at least in my opinion. ðŸ˜‰ </center></td>

<td><center>During my free time I enjoy watching Netflix, my favorite show genres are reality tv, sitcoms and international dramas. Obviously I do quite a bit of baking since I'm a foodie, I like baking chewy chocolate chip cookies and fudge brownies. I love my Ping Pong with my family and doing jigsaw puzzles during my alone time, the biggest puzzle I've ever done was 2000 pieces but I do hope to do a 3000 pieces one day!! </center></td>
